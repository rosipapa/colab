Titanic Dataset Analysis with CatBoost

Explore the Kaggle Titanic dataset with the power of CatBoost, a machine learning library designed for categorical feature support. CatBoost optimizes model training efficiency and accuracy, making it an excellent choice for this classification task. The project delves into feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, demonstrating the prowess of CatBoost in predicting survival outcomes.

Synthetic Audio Detection using Spectrogram and CNN

Uncover the world of synthetic audio detection through the lens of spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project leverages the unique visual representation of sound – the spectrogram – to identify synthetic audio patterns. By employing CNNs, the model learns intricate features in the spectrogram, showcasing how deep learning techniques can enhance audio analysis.

Jira Dashboard Customization

Dive into the significance of customizing Jira dashboards to enhance project management. This project explores the creation of a personalized Jira dashboard, emphasizing the importance of tailored graphics for better visualization and decision-making. Learn how a well-designed Jira dashboard can streamline workflows, improve team collaboration, and provide valuable insights for effective project management.

Value vs Effort Matrix for Backlog Prioritization

Understand the rationale behind using a Value vs Effort matrix as a powerful tool for backlog prioritization. This project introduces a matrix that categorizes features based on their value and effort, aiding product owners in making strategic decisions. By visualizing the impact and effort of each feature, this matrix becomes an essential asset for prioritizing backlog items, ensuring a balanced and informed approach to product development.

Mall Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on clustering mall customers based on their behavior, preferences, and spending patterns. K-Means algorithm, is an algorithm that iteratively assigns data points to clusters, optimizing them for distinct characteristics. To determine the optimal number of clusters was used the Elbow Method, a visual aid that identifies the point of maximum within-cluster sum of squares. 

Benford Law for First Digit

This project explores Benford's Law, a phenomenon stating that in naturally occurring numerical datasets, smaller digits (1, 2, 3) are more likely to be leading digits. Utilizing statistical tests such as the chi-square test and p-value analysis, it assesses how well real-world datasets conform to this law. The chi-square test determines the statistical significance of any deviations observed, while the p-value indicates the probability of obtaining such results by chance. This analysis offers valuable insights into data integrity and potential irregularities.
